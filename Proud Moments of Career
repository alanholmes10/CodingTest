There are 2 moments that I would be proud of in my coding career.

1) My Final Year Project is something I was very proud of, I received an A grade for the project and I forced myself out of the comfort zone by taking on a new aspects of development in learning Python and Django. I also took on new technologies such and AWS and managed to set up a successful instance for my project. Also even though I was working by myself I kept to agile methods, working in sprints, using trello as a SCRUM board. I feel this helped me through the workload. In the end I was delighted with the work load I got through and was extremely proud of my achievements

2) Being introduced to the codebase in Scurri and being one of the first of the support crew that was encouraged to use the code to solve issues, something that I feel I have used well and has brought me on as a programmer. I hope to soon get Scurri running locally on my computer.

I hope this is the start of a journey to the development team in Scurri and I am excited to grow and learn from the team. Thanks for the opportunity
